# OrganizeReports
Python script used to organize 5000+ safety reports for a construction company I worked for. No reports included only the code.

Begins with a large list of randomly ordered safety reports, then creates a system of folders organized by subcompany and projects within that subcompany.

Then uses openpyxl to create an excel sheet for each project that contains a list of all safety reports. Hopefully will be updated with a bot to download detail reports from the web.
